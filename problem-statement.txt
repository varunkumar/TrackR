TrackR: Today we sought help from social media on various events like asking for blood units for surgery, looking for information on lost & found pets, trying to sell your tickets, etc, etc. The problem, however, is that people share information about these events without knowing the validity of them. TrackR is a hack to track the validity of such events so that you get spammed with calls, comments, or RTs.  You get spammed by calls, comments, RTs, etc. 

Events:
- Blood requirements: People typically pass phone numbers on tweets. You get spammed with calls as more people RT. You get calls even after you get the required units of blood. 
Primary Social media: Twitter
Highlights: 
1. Enable tracking with a simple hashtag
2. Send an SMS to change the validity of the event
3. Book a cab for the donors
4. Uses NLP to match the RTs and Shares.

- Lost & found pets / people: People post info about lost pets on Facebook along with the photo. We use image processing algos to match the photo with found pets.
